# Greet

Make a Greeting class that can print out greeting messages.  The makefile is fairly generic, and, if you structure your project as

```
src/*.cpp
include/*.h
tmp/*.o - temporary object files
lib/*.so - external shared libraries
bin/XXXX - programs built from src/main_XXXX.cpp
bin/test_XXXX - tests built from src/test_XXXX.cpp
```

You can use make clean/all without modifying Makefile and Makefile.googletest


## Build

```bash
make clean
make all
```

## Test

```bash
bin/test_greet
```

## Run

```bash
bin/greet
```

## Clean-Build-Test Screen Capture

Note it says hello, but I moved the project to "greet" for a simpler hello...

## Docker

To create a reproducible build (advanced) and you have docker installed, you can do the following:

```bash
docker build -t cpp-greet .
docker run --rm cpp-greet test_greet # test
docker run --rm cpp-greet greet # run
```
